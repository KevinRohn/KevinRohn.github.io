My interests focus on embedded device development and connected services. I have been working as a software developer for over 7 years.
During this time, I was able to gain a lot of experience in different areas. Among other things, these cover specific topics such as over-the-air updates.

> My motto is to start with learning by doing, try out what works best, focus on what is required and get things done.
  Learn from the progress and deepen knowledge in the relevant areas.
